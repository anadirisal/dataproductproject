Data and the application

This is a simple application that shows graphing capability.

This is a shiny application that is final presentation for the Course Project of the “Developing data products” course. This course is part of the “Data Science specialization”. The project consists in two activities: creating a Shiny application and create a presentation in Rstudio Presenter to pitch for the application.

For this assignment, we used the gapminder dataset from UsingR package.

This is a tabulated data set providing longitudinal data on GDP, population and Life Expectancy. I have filtered just the data for the Americas.

The code for this application can be found in the github address:

It provides a moving graphics of GDP against Life Expectancy which is very illuminating.
